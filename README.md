# Sleepy Event Management App

Have you ever wanted to host an event but had nowhere to post it?

Sleepy aims to make event joining fair. This means no sitting in front of your computer waiting for signs up to open. Simply place your name on the waitlist and wait for our lottery system to choose you!
