    <string name="lottery_guidelines">Signing up for events through Sleepy works on a lottery system!
   Since we have so many people wanting to sign up for events, we like to give everyone an equal
   chance of getting in without waiting in front of your computer for sign up time or in a long
   line at the rec centre.\n\nAll event have a registration period which are the dates that people
   can join the waitlist. You will know if an event is open for registration when the event details
   have a Join Waitlist button at the bottom. When you click to join a waitlist, you will be prompted
   for your information. Once you confirm your information, you will be placed on the waitlist.\n\nOnce
   the registration window ends, a random group of people off the waitlist will be sent invites to
   enroll in the event. Upon this initial selection, you will be sent a notification on whether you
   were invited or not but do not worry! This is not your last chance.\n\nWhen notified that you have
   not been invited to enroll, you will be asked if you would like to stay on the waitlist. If you
   stay on the waitlist, you will be given the chance to still be invited in the case that someone
   else who was invited chooses to decline their invitation.\n\nIf you were invited to enroll in an
   event, you can either decline and not enroll or accept and enroll in the event. Upon enrollment
   you will be able to attend the event once it begins. We ask that all people invited accept or
   decline their invitations as soon as they can to give others a chance to enroll.\n\nGood luck!\n
